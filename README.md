# Game_SpaceShooter3D
 Game developed for my Game Development class at the software engineering college.

# Story
## In the Unity, create a new project and do:

- Create a Space Shooter-style game, the game need to have a ship that fires projectiles at enemies (other ships, meteors, aliens or monsters).

- The game needs to have a main menu interface to user start the game, set configs or exit the game.
- The game needs to have the minimum of two game phases.

Tip: You can control all the game by the Scenes or try to implement a Scene Control by the Game Manager.

## Extras: 
- Implement sound effects to shot, destroy, background sounds and other sounds you would like to add.
- Implement an Booster System, that the player can collect and receive a bonus like shoot speed, movement speed, shots number, a shield to protect him or any other type of booster you would like to implement.
